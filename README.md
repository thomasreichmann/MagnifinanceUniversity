# Magnifinance University

This repo contains the project that mas made as a test for Magnifinance

## Back End

The back end was made using ASP.net core and Entity Framework Core
It is also serving our front-end through its proxy

## Front End

The front end was made unsing Angular and typescript for client-side code, material.angular for layout and styling
It is capable of listing all of the models created by the back end (Course, Student, Subject, Teacher) but it cannot perform the CRUD operations,
those are only perfomable through endpoints and tools like postman.

## Running

To run the application quickly, open the `startup.cmd` file, go to `localhost:7171` and wait for the proxy to load
